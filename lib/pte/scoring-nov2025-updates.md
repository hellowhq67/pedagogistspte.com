# PTE Academic Scoring Updates - November 2025

## Major Scoring Changes

### 1. Essay Writing (Write Essay) - Expanded Scale
**Old Scale:** 0-3 per criterion
**New Scale:** 0-6 per criterion (effective August 7, 2025)

**Scoring Criteria (each 0-6):**
1. **Content** (0-6): Relevance, supporting data, examples, explanations
2. **Development, Structure and Coherence** (0-6): Logical organization and idea development
3. **General Linguistic Range** (0-6): Vocabulary and language complexity

**Form Requirements:**
- Optimal word count: 200-300 words
- Responses under 120 words or over 380 words are rejected

**Implementation Impact:**
- AI scoring rubrics must use 0-6 scale instead of 0-3
- More granular assessment possible
- Better feedback precision

### 2. Summarize Written Text - Expanded Content Scale
**Old Scale:** 0-2 for content
**New Scale:** 0-4 for content (doubled range)

**Benefits:**
- More granular assessment
- Better feedback precision
- Clearer differentiation between performance levels

### 3. Read Aloud - Single-Skill Scoring Change
**Old System:** Contributed to both Speaking AND Reading scores
**New System (August 2025):** Contributes **only to Speaking**, no longer to Reading

**Impact:**
- Test-takers can no longer boost Reading scores through Read Aloud performance
- Read Aloud carries less overall importance in the test
- Focus should be on speaking delivery quality (pronunciation, fluency)
- Each skill requires independent strengthening
- Reading section now relies entirely on reading-specific question types

### 4. Hybrid Scoring: AI + Human Review (August 2025)

**Speaking Tasks with Human Review:**
- Describe Image
- Retell Lecture
- Summarize Group Discussion (new)
- Respond to a Situation (new)

**Writing Tasks with Human Review:**
- Write Essay (WE)
- Summarize Written Text (SWT)
- Summarize Spoken Text (SST)

**Human reviewers check:**
- Content quality and relevance (NOT pronunciation or fluency)
- Originality of responses
- Detection of memorized templates

**Template Detection:**
- AI flags responses that appear overly templated or copied
- Flagged responses undergo human review
- Encourages authentic, spontaneous language use
- Reduces over-reliance on memorized templates

### 5. Updated Score Equivalence Table (July 2025)

| PTE Academic | IELTS Band | TOEFL iBT |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| 86-90        | 9.0        | 118-120   |
| 73-75        | 7.5        | 102-109   |
| 65           | 7.0        | 94-101    |
| 59-64        | 6.5        | 79-93     |
| 51-58        | 6.0        | 60-78     |
| 36-42        | 5.0        | 35-45     |

**Important Note:** Test-takers aiming for IELTS band 7-9 equivalence will require higher PTE scores than previously.
